** Introduction **

This README is divided into three parts. Each part contains a dataset of 500 points and they will be created by different way. In addition, there are four methods to determine the distance of two clusters in each part, each method use the same dataset to calculate the distance.Moreover, k, p, d are user-specified parameter values, and I will be supposed each of them in each part, all parts have the same value . After getting the silhouette coefficient from each method, I will choose the silhouette coefficient which is close to 1, and it means that method has the best performance. Finally, I will give the conclusion.
